# A11y — Standalone Accessibility Audit

Quick accessibility and visual design review. This is a shortcut that runs just the **a11y layer** from the design quality engine.

For a full composite audit (craft + aesthetic + a11y), use `/design-review` instead.

## Setup

1. Load the a11y layer reference from `~/.claude/skills/design/design-quality/layers/a11y.md`
2. If a `## Design Quality` section exists in the project's `CLAUDE.md`, respect **Strictness** and **Teaching** settings
3. Otherwise, use defaults: strictness `standard`, teaching `normal`

## Target

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, analyze that specific file or path.
If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask the user which file(s) to review, or offer to scan the project for component files.

## Execution

Run the accessibility and visual design checks defined in `layers/a11y.md`:

1. **Critical a11y checks (A1-A5):** Must fix — missing image descriptions, unnamed controls, unlabeled fields, non-keyboard handlers, broken link semantics
2. **Serious a11y checks (A6-A12):** Should fix — focus indicators, keyboard interaction, color-only info, touch targets, contrast, page language, link text
3. **Moderate a11y checks (A13-A20):** Consider fixing — heading hierarchy, tabIndex, ARIA roles, motion preferences, live regions, skip nav, autocomplete, page title
4. **WCAG 2.2 checks (A21-A24):** Should fix — accessible authentication, redundant entry, consistent help, dragging alternatives
5. **Modern HTML checks (M1-M4):** Consider — native dialog, inert, popover API, DOM vs visual order
6. **Visual checks (V1-V18):** Layout, typography, color, component states, error messaging

Be specific with line numbers and code snippets. Provide fixes, not just problems. Prioritize critical accessibility issues first.

## Output

Use the standalone output format defined in `layers/a11y.md` — the A11Y DESIGN REVIEW banner format with severity sections and summary score.

If asked, offer to fix the issues directly.
